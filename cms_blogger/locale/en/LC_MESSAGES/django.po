"This blogging tool allows you to select the layouts - header, footer, "
"and right rail - for blog landing pages and blog entry pages. You may "
"choose one layout for both types of pages, or separate layouts for blog "
"landing pages and blog entry pages. <br/>"
"<b>NOTE</b>: Because of the way blogs work, you must select a page"
" that has a template with the extra-page-content and main-content "
"placeholders. Those two placeholders will be used by all blog-related pages"
" and will not be available for non-programmatic blog content. "

"The Blog setup admin allows you to create and customize a blog for your "
"site. All blogs will exist after a /blog/ URL, meaning your site may not "
"have any page with 'blog' as the slug. There are two main types of blog "
"pages: the blog landing page, which contains a list of blog entries - "
"titles, images, and summaries - in reverse chronological order; and blog "
"entry pages, which are the individual pages on which blog entries appear."
"<br/> This admin allows you to give your blog a title, tagline, and branding"
" image; pick layouts for each type of page - blog landing page, blog entry "
"page, and blog bio page; select whether the blog will appear in site "
"navigation (menu); and integrate social media and Disqus commenting."
