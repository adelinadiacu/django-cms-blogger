"The Blog setup admin allows you to create and customize a blog for your "

"have any page with 'blog' as the slug. There are two main types of blog "
"pages: the blog landing page, which contains a list of blog entries - "
"titles, images, and summaries - in reverse chronological order; and blog "
"entry pages, which are the individual pages on which blog entries appear.<br/"
"> This admin allows you to give your blog a title, tagline, and branding "
"image; pick layouts for each type of page - blog landing page, blog entry "
"page, and blog bio page; select whether the blog will appear in site "
"navigation (menu); and integrate social media and Disqus commenting."
