"must select a page that has a template with the extra-page-content and main-"
"content placeholders. Those two placeholders will be used by all blog-"

"entry pages, which are the individual pages on which blog entries appear.<br/"
"> This admin allows you to give your blog a title, tagline, and branding "
"image; pick layouts for each type of page - blog landing page, blog entry "
"page, and blog bio page; select whether the blog will appear in site "
"navigation (menu); and integrate social media and Disqus commenting."
