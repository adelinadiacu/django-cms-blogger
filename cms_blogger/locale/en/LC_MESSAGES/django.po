"entry pages, which are the individual pages on which blog entries appear.<br/"

"image; pick layouts for each type of page - blog landing page, blog entry "
"page, and blog bio page; select whether the blog will appear in site "
"navigation (menu); and integrate social media and Disqus commenting."
